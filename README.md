## Overview

1- The video file is opened, and various video properties such as fps, width, and height are obtained.

2- Face detection is performed using **MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)**.

3- The detected face is transformed into a feature vector using a pre-trained **Inception Resnet V1 model (InceptionResnetV1)**.

4- A comparison is made with the face in the previous frame, and a similarity score is calculated.

5- Similarity scores below a certain threshold are considered as indicative of a deepfake.

6- If deepfakes are detected in a consecutive number of frames, it is marked as a deepfake, and a frame is added to the video.

7- Processed frames are written to an output video file.
